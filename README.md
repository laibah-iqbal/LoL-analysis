# League of Legends Match Outcome Analysis #

## Motivation: ##

This project is motivated by my own love for Riot Games' beloved MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) game, League of Legends. A LoL game, on average, lasts about 40 minutes so I wanted to analyze this dataset to answer the questions:

- **How important are the first 10 minutes of a League of Legends game in determining the outcome of the game?**
- **Can teams recover after poor performance early game?**
- **What is different early game between teams that turn games around after poor performance and those that don't?**

Besides answering the questions, the goal of this project is also to become a better storyteller with data. I want to present my insights in a clear, concise manner and make sure that my analysis is deliberate and focused on answering interesting questions that emerge from the dataset instead of straying towards fancy techniques.

## Limitations: ##

Dataset did not have data for what champion each player was playing and Rank of the players playing. In revisiting this project, I plan to further deep dive into these data points to build a more complete picture of current meta dynamics.
